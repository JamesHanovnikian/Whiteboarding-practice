# Given an array of strings, return a hash that provides of a count of how many times each string occurs.

# Input: ["Dewey", "Truman", "Dewey", "Dewey", "Truman", "Truman", "Dewey", "Truman", "Truman", "Dewey", "Dewey"]

# Output: {"Dewey" => 6, "Truman" => 5}

# Explanation: "Dewey" occurs 6 times in the array, while "Truman" occurs 5 times.

# make an empty hash variable for a count
# while loop to go through array
# if an index on the array does not appear in the hash, set the value for that key to 0
# if we see the key during an iteration, add one to the count.

# def string_count(array)
#   string_frequencies = {}
#   i = 0
#   while i < array.length

# Given a hash, where the keys are strings representing food items, and the values are numbers representing the price of each food, return the amount someone would pay if they'd order one of each food from the entire menu.

# Input: {"hot dog" => 2, "hamburger" => 3, "steak sandwich" => 5, "fries" => 1, "cole slaw" => 1, "soda" => 2}

# Output: 14

# Explanation: If someone would order one of everything on the menu, they'd pay a total of 14 (the sum of all the hash's values).

# make a variable holding the sum of the prices
# each loop iterating through key and value
# take the value and add it the running sum
# return the sum

# def menu_sum(items)
#   sum = 0
#   items.each do |key, value|
#     sum = value + sum

# Given an array of hashes that represent a list of social media posts, return a new array that only contains the posts that have at least 1000 likes.

# {title: 'i never knew how cool i was until now', submitted_by: "Lyndon Johnson", likes: 3},

# {title: 'Me Eating Pizza', submitted_by: "Joelle P.", likes: 1549},
